   The Day My Heart Chose You”
                  The first moment I saw you stepping into that bus .I didn’t know anything about you .
                  You were just a girl boarding a bus… but to me, that moment was the beginning of a new universe.
                  I still remember praying silently, wishing somehow you would sit near me, wishing just to be close. That first glance wasn’t just a memory — it is the moment that built my entire life’s purpose.
                  From that day, my heart has belonged to you in a way words can never fully explain.
